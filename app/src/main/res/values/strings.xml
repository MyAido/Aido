    <string name="accessibility_service_description">Aido provides AI-powered writing assistance across all apps. It detects when you type trigger commands (like @fixg) or select text to offer intelligent suggestions. Aido reads text in the current input field or your selection to process it. Data is only processed when you explicitly use a trigger or the selection menu. You control which AI provider processes your data.</string>
